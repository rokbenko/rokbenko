Hi, I'm Rok! <img src = "./wave.gif" width="20" />

I‚Äôm a self-taught developer whose tech journey was defined by two key "wow" moments that shaped my life and led me to pursue a career in tech, even though I completed a Master's in economics. üëá

The first was in 2017 during high school, in a 2-hour class on HTML and CSS. My class created a basic website and opened it in a browser. ‚ÄúWait, you can make a website with just one HTML file???‚Äù ü§Ø That simple realization sparked my curiosity, and I started learning HTML and CSS every day after school.

The second was in 2022, when I made my first OpenAI API call to the GPT-3 model, which was SOTA at the time. I asked it, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Einstein?‚Äù and was amazed by the response. "How the hell does AI know that???" ü§Ø This experience introduced me to the world of AI, where I quickly became an active community contributor. In 2023, I achieved the title of the üèÜ <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/openai-api/topusers" target="_blank">#1 OpenAI API contributor</a> on Stack Overflow, and in 2024, I earned the title of the üèÜ <a href="https://community.crewai.com/leaderboard" target="_blank">#1 CrewAI contributor</a> on the official Discourse forum.

What‚Äôs funny is that those two moments found me, not the other way around. ü§î I came across frontend development by enrolling in an Informatics course, not knowing it included 2 hours of HTML and CSS. Similarly, I first heard about OpenAI while listening to a non-technical podcast, not expecting it to come up.

Today, I work as an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rokbenko">AI Engineer</a> at a Stealth Startup while also sharing my knowledge through my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rokbenko?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">Code AI with Rok</a> üöÄ, where I create:

‚úîÔ∏è 100% practical coding tutorials related to AI.<br>
‚ùå 0% theory (without showing the code).<br>
‚ùå 0% fluff.<br>
‚ùå 0% clickbaits.<br>

All my work is available in my GitHub repository, <a href="https://github.com/rokbenko/ai-playground">ai-playground</a> üöÄ, demonstrating my commitment to both learning and teaching in the tech community.
