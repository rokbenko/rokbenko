Hi, I'm Rok! <img src = "./wave.gif" width="20" />

I wrote my first line of HTML in 2017 during a 2-hour high school class. Not knowing that you can make a simple website with a single HTML file, I was blown away! I rushed home and started coding every day, making sites with cheap animations and proudly showing them to my family even though I couldn’t tell Java from JavaScript. It didn’t matter. I was hooked. 🤩

Fast-forward a few years. I got a Master’s in economics, but I kept coding. In 2022, I made my first API call to OpenAI’s GPT-3, which was SOTA at the time. Damn! I jumped into the AI rabbit hole like Neo before the red pill even hit his tongue. 💊

From 2022 to 2024, I lived on Stack Overflow, helping developers implement the OpenAI API. I became the #1 OpenAI API contributor on Stack Overflow. Hundreds of answers written, thousands of reputation points gained, ∞ hours spent, but that didn't help me land a job. In 2024 I applied for ≈400 job posts. I finally got one as an AI engineer after 12 months. Guess what? I was fired after 1.5 months! That broke me but woke me. I dropped community contributions to 0 overnight. No more free work. No more chasing reputation points. You can't buy groceries with that. 💰

In 2025, I stepped on a path of becoming a solopreneur, building apps with AI in public. Prior to that I never shipped ANYTHING in production. Not a single landing page was deployed. Nothing was ever good enough. The term MVP was not in my vocabulary. 😬

Now I'm all in. Like, ALL IN. I’m not Pieter Levels, Marc Lou, or [insert your favorite indie developer]. Yet! But I started launching apps. The identity shift from “community contributor” to “solopreneur” was brutal. It’s not easy to lose a crown, whatever the title you got the crown for. A crown is a crown. But fu€k it! I’d rather wear a battle-worn one I earned than a shiny one that got me nowhere. I’m building in public now: wins, losses, all of it. 🔥
